# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## 📁 Projects

### 1. ✍️ Signature Verification Using Siamese Neural Network
- **Description**: This project uses a Siamese Neural Network to verify handwritten signatures by comparing an original signature with a test signature (genuine or forged). It leverages convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and calculates similarity scores between signatures.
- **Key Features**:
  - Siamese architecture with contrastive-style loss
  - Upload and compare signature images via notebook
  - Calculates similarity score and makes match prediction
  - Accuracy and precision evaluation
  - Lightweight dummy dataset used (real datasets can be integrated)
  - Saved model for reuse

---

### 2. 🎭 BERT Sentiment Classification on IMDb
- **Description**: Uses BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sentiment analysis on the IMDb movie reviews dataset. The model classifies reviews as positive or negative.
- **Key Features**:
  - Text preprocessing and tokenization with HuggingFace
  - BERT fine-tuning and evaluation
  - Visualization of sentiment predictions

---

### 3. 🧠 Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
- **Description**: A simple implementation of a GAN using the MNIST dataset. Shows how a generator creates realistic digits and the discriminator evaluates them.
- **Key Features**:
  - Generator and Discriminator models
  - Training with adversarial loss
  - Visualization of generated images

---

### 4. 📈 LSTM & GRU for Sequence Modeling
- **Description**: Compares LSTM and GRU architectures for sequence modeling tasks such as time series prediction or text generation.
- **Key Features**:
  - Implementation of LSTM and GRU from scratch
  - Performance comparison on sequential data
  - Evaluation and visualization of predictions

---

### 5. 🧩 YOLO (You Only Look Once) Object Detection
- **Description**: Real-time object detection using YOLO. The model detects objects in images with high speed and decent accuracy.
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time detection on images
  - Integration with OpenCV
  - Pretrained YOLO model demonstration
