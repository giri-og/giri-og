# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects that demonstrate the implementation of popular models and techniques.

## Projects

### 1. **BERT Sentiment Classification on IMDb**
   - **Description**: This notebook uses BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sentiment analysis on the IMDb movie reviews dataset. The model classifies reviews as either positive or negative.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Data preprocessing
     - Tokenization and encoding with HuggingFace Transformers
     - Model training and evaluation
     - Visualization of results

### 2. **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**
   - **Description**: A simple implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the MNIST dataset. This notebook showcases how the generator and discriminator work together to generate new, realistic-looking images.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Generator and discriminator architecture
     - Model training loop
     - Visualization of generated images

### 3. **LSTM & GRU for Sequence Modeling**
   - **Description**: This notebook compares Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models for sequence prediction tasks. It demonstrates their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.
   - **Key Features**:
     - LSTM and GRU architectures
     - Model training and evaluation on sequential data
     - Comparison of model performance

### 4. **YOLO (You Only Look Once) Object Detection**
   - **Description**: This notebook implements YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection. YOLO is an efficient model for detecting objects in images or videos with high accuracy and speed.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Object detection using YOLO
     - Real-time detection on sample images
     - Model training and evaluation

## Requirements

To run these notebooks, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- HuggingFace Transformers (for BERT)
- OpenCV (for image processing in YOLO)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)

You can install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired notebook and run the code.
