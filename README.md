## 📁 Projects

### 1. ✍️ Signature Verification Using Siamese Neural Network
- **Description**: This project uses a Siamese Neural Network to verify handwritten signatures by comparing an original signature with a test signature (genuine or forged). It leverages convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and calculates similarity scores between signatures.
- **Key Features**:
  - Siamese architecture with contrastive-style loss
  - Upload and compare signature images via notebook
  - Calculates similarity score and makes match prediction
  - Accuracy and precision evaluation
  - Lightweight dummy dataset used (real datasets can be integrated)
  - Saved model for reuse

### 2. 🎭 BERT Sentiment Classification on IMDb
- **Description**: Uses BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sentiment analysis on the IMDb movie reviews dataset. The model classifies reviews as positive or negative.
- **Key Features**:
  - Text preprocessing and tokenization with HuggingFace
  - BERT fine-tuning and evaluation
  - Visualization of sentiment predictions

---

### 3. 🧠 Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
- **Description**: A simple implementation of a GAN using the MNIST dataset. Shows how a generator creates realistic digits and the discriminator evaluates them.
- **Key Features**:
  - Generator and Discriminator models
  - Training with adversarial loss
  - Visualization of generated images

---

### 4. 📈 LSTM & GRU for Sequence Modeling
- **Description**: Compares LSTM and GRU architectures for sequence modeling tasks such as time series prediction or text generation.
- **Key Features**:
  - Implementation of LSTM and GRU from scratch
  - Performance comparison on sequential data
  - Evaluation and visualization of predictions

---

### 5. 🧩 YOLO (You Only Look Once) Object Detection
- **Description**: Real-time object detection using YOLO. The model detects objects in images with high speed and decent accuracy.
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time detection on images
  - Integration with OpenCV
  - Pretrained YOLO model demonstration
